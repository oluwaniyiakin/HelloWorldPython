# Overview

This project is a basic Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. As a software engineer in training, I created this software to continue developing my skills with Python programming and version control using Git and GitHub.

The purpose of this project is to ensure that I can successfully set up a development environment, create and run a simple program, document my code, and publish it to a public GitHub repository. It also helps me practice creating instructional videos and documenting my work professionally.
